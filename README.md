# OAuth_Flow

Explain OAuth for those who know naught:

OAuth is like giving a valet key to a car instead of your actual keys. You let someone else (like an app) use a limited key (token) to access certain things (like your photos) for a short time, without giving away your main key (password). This keeps your main key safe and gives you control over who can access your stuff.

Explain OAuth with a more technical explanation: 

OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization on the internet. It allows a user to grant a third-party application access to their resources without sharing their credentials. OAuth works by enabling users to approve an application to act on their behalf without sharing their password. Instead of using passwords, OAuth uses tokens that grant access to specific resources for a specific amount of time. This token-based approach enhances security by reducing the risk of exposing user credentials. OAuth is widely used in various applications and services, including social media platforms, cloud storage services, and APIs, to provide secure and delegated access to resources.
